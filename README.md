## Corporate Diversification 🧑‍🎓
* This research project is part of the Methodology Section of my PhD Dissertation about Corporate Diversification and Firm Performance.
* A series of ML models are built to explore the relationship between relevant Business-Financial Features and Corporate Diversification.

## Project Description 📑
The main goal is to elaborate a series of ML models with optimal tunned hyper-parameters that relate relevant Business and Financial Features with Corporate Diversification.

- Relevant Features:                                                                                                                                               
    - Firm Size                                                                                                                                                     
    - Cash Holdings                                                                                                                                                 
    - Asset Turnover
    - Return on Assets
    - Debt
    - QuickRatio
- Corporate Diversification metrics:
    - Entropy
    - Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
    - A Proposed Measure of Diversification 

## Data Source📊
- A random sample of 71 Mexican diversified listed companies were selected for the periods 2014 and 2017.  
- Financial firms were eliminated due to the regulatory constraints that might distort the analysis, however, industrial firms with financial segments were not excluded, as excluding these would eliminate very large diversified firms that operate a finance division. 
- All diversified firms with complete data that traded through the time frame were included, since the three-year period was chosen to purposely allow companies to engage in corporate diversification and experience critical changes in corporate structure.

## Findings 📈
- Positive relationships with Corporate Diversification
    - Firm Size 
    - Asset Turnover
- Negative relationships with Corporate Diversification
    - Return on Assets
    - Cash Holdings
